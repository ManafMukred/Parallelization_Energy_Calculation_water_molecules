# Parallelization_Energy_Calculation_water_molecules
This project was based on parallelizing the calculation of 10k&amp;100k water molecules with different box sizes. The results showed some consistency except for few irregularities in overhead and other fields, but all in all, the results were a good practical example to reflect the time efficiency of parallelization.
